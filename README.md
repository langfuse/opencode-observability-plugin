# Langfuse OpenCode Plugin

OpenCode plugin that sends OpenCode session telemetry to Langfuse. It traces user turns, assistant generations, tool calls, retries, reasoning output, compaction output, and failed generation steps.

## Quick Start

For OpenCode 2, enable the plugin in your configuration:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@langfuse/opencode-observability-plugin@latest"]
}
```

For OpenCode 1, use the same package in your `opencode.json` or `opencode.jsonc`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["@langfuse/opencode-observability-plugin@latest"]
}
```

Restart OpenCode after changing the config.

## Supported Versions

The default package entrypoint supports both OpenCode 1 and OpenCode 2. OpenCode
1 calls the plugin's `server()` implementation, while OpenCode 2 calls its
`setup()` implementation. The `/v1` and `/v2` entrypoints remain available for
direct imports.

Validated versions and entrypoints:

- OpenCode `2.0.4` and newer: `@langfuse/opencode-observability-plugin`
- OpenCode `1.18.29` and newer: `@langfuse/opencode-observability-plugin`

## Langfuse Credentials

Create `~/.config/opencode/opencode-langfuse.json` with your Langfuse credentials.

```json
{
  "publicKey": "pk-lf-...",
  "secretKey": "sk-lf-...",
  "baseUrl": "https://cloud.langfuse.com",
  "environment": "development",
  "userId": "your-user-id"
}
```

Only `publicKey` and `secretKey` are required. If `baseUrl` is not set, the plugin uses `https://cloud.langfuse.com`. If `environment` is not set, it uses `development`.

You can also set credentials with environment variables:

```bash
export LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk-lf-..."
export LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="sk-lf-..."
export LANGFUSE_BASE_URL="https://cloud.langfuse.com"
export LANGFUSE_ENVIRONMENT="development"
export LANGFUSE_USER_ID="your-user-id"
```

If both `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` are set, the plugin uses environment variables instead of reading the config file. Optional values can be supplied either way.

## Per-Session User

`userId` and `LANGFUSE_USER_ID` apply to the whole OpenCode process. When one process hosts sessions for several people, for example behind `opencode serve`, set the user on the session instead by creating it with session metadata, for example `POST /session` with:

```json
{
  "metadata": { "userId": "user_01ABC" }
}
```

`metadata.userId` becomes the Langfuse user of every span of that session. It takes precedence over the process-wide user, which still applies to sessions without it. It must be a non-empty string; anything else is ignored. Child agent sessions inherit the user of their parent session.

The plugin takes the metadata from OpenCode's session events. For a session it has not seen an event for, such as one continued after OpenCode was restarted, it reads the session from OpenCode before tracing its first span. If that read fails, the turn is traced with the process-wide user and the read is repeated on the session's next turn.
